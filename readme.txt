Take the frustration out of cross-platform icons. Let Quick Favicon create them for you! Favicons! iOS! Android! Windows 8.x Tiles! Complete with On-Screen Previews!

== Description ==

Easily upload and set a Favicon (browser icon, shortcut icon) for your WordPress site. You may also upload and set icons specifically for iOS devices (apple touch), Android devices and Windows 8.x Tiles.

It's even possible to set a different Favicon for both the front-end and dashboard areas of your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `quick-favicon` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You can then click on `Favicon` on the administration menu and begin configuring your icons!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can a different icon be used for both the front and back-end of a site? =

Yes. You can set a separate icon OR set the same icon for both areas.

= The sizes listed on the Windows tab are not the actual sizes that Microsoft recommends! =

True. Those sizes are basically the minimum-margins. If you look at the images themselves after they are generated, they do match Microsoft's recommended sizes. The reason for this is that they want to ensure smooth graphic quality on systems with large displays. Down-scaling is the only way to keep clean images.

== Screenshots ==

1. Make your mark in the world of browser tabs! Both the front-end (public) and back-end (dashboard) of your site may have a different Favicon, if you wish. Three icon sizes are generated from the given image to cover Google TV (96 x 96), Safari on Mac OS (32 x 32), and standard Favicon (16 x 16).

4. Windows 8.x Tiles are groovy, baby! You'll look like a pro when your site looks like a native Windows 8 app. Choose from a recommended tile color or choose your own. The sky is the limit. Five tile icon sizes are generated from the given image to cover Windows 8 / IE11 (70 x 70, 150 x 150, 310 x 150 and 310 x 310) and Windows 8 / IE10 (144 x 144).
