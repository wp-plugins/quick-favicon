3. Upload the extracted `quick-favicon` directory to your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

= Using Quick Favicon =

After installing Quick Favicon, you can access your Icon Settings two ways.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed Quick Favicon. Where are my settings? =

After installing Quick Favicon, you can access your Icon Settings two ways.

1. By clicking `Icon Settings` on the Plugins page in your Dashboard
2. By clicking `Icons` on the Appearance menu in your Dashboard

= Can a different icon be used for both the front and back-end of a site? =

Yes. You can set a separate icon OR set the same icon for both areas.

= The sizes listed on the Windows tab are not the actual sizes that Microsoft recommends! =

True. Those sizes are basically the minimum-margins. If you look at the images themselves after they are generated, they do match Microsoft's recommended sizes. The reason for this is that they want to ensure smooth graphic quality on systems with large displays. Down-scaling is the only way to keep clean images.

== Screenshots ==

1. Make your mark in the world of browser tabs! Both the front-end (public) and back-end (dashboard) of your site may have a different Favicon, if you wish. Three icon sizes are generated from the given image to cover Google TV (96 x 96), Safari on Mac OS (32 x 32), and standard Favicon (16 x 16).

4. Windows 8.x Tiles are groovy, baby! You'll look like a pro when your site looks like a native Windows 8 app. Choose from a recommended tile color or choose your own. The sky is the limit.
